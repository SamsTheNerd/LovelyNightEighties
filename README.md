## Themes/Addons
I've been slowly adding this theme to the apps I use, but I only use so many apps. If anyone ports it to other apps, let me know! I'll add links here. For now here's what we have:
- [VS Code](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties/tree/main/lovelynighteighties_vscode) (Only really tested on Mac and not extensively, if there's any component I missed changing, let me know)
- [iTerm2](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties/blob/main/lovelynighteighties_iterm2.json)
- [MacOS Terminal Icon](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties/blob/main/macos_terminal_icon.png) - great for terminal or iTerm2
