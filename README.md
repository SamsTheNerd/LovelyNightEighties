## Themes/Addons
I've been slowly adding this theme to the apps I use, but I only use so many apps. If anyone ports it to other apps, let me know! I'll add links here. For now here's what we have:
- [VS Code](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties/tree/main/vscode) (Only really tested on Mac and not extensively, if there's any component I missed changing, let me know) 
    - To install: put the lovelynighteighties_vscode folder into your installed extensions folder listed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_where-are-extensions-installed)
- [iTerm2](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties/blob/main/iterm2/lovelynighteighties_iterm2.json)
- [MacOS Terminal Icon](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties/blob/main/macos_terminal_icon.png) - great for terminal or iTerm2
- [NeoVim](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties/tree/main/nvim) - 
	- To install: 
	| Plugin Manager | Install with... |
	| ------------- | ------------- |
	| [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) | `NeoBundle 'SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties', {'rtp': 'nvim'}` |
	| [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) | `Plugin 'SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties', { 'rtp': 'nvim/'}` |
	| [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) | `Plug 'SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties', { 'rtp': 'nvim' }` |
	| [Dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim) | `call dein#add('SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties', {'rtp': 'nvim'})` |
	| [minpac](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac/) | `call minpac#add('SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties', {'subdir': 'nvim'})` |
	| [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) | `use {'tanvirtin/monokai.nvim', rtp = 'nvim'} |

- [vim-airline](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/LovelyNightEighties/tree/main/vim-airline-themes) - Complements the NeoVim theme very nicely!
	- To install, simply copy the contents of the `vim-airline-themes` into your `vim-airline-themes/` directory.
